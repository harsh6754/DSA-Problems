# DSA Problems Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Problems** repository! This repository contains solutions to a wide variety of Data Structures and Algorithms problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and **HackerRank**.

## Key Highlights:
- **Languages Used**: C++, Python, Java
- **Organized by Platforms and Sheets**: 
  - **NeetCode**, **ArshGoyal DSA Sheet**, etc.
- **Topics Covered**: 
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graphs
  - Sorting
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - And more!

## Purpose:
This repository serves as a personal tracker of my learning progress, a resource for others to refer to for efficient problem-solving, and preparation material for coding interviews and competitive programming contests.

## About Me:
I'm **Harsh Agrawal**, a final year Computer Science and Engineering student with a passion for solving algorithmic challenges. With over 600+ DSA problems solved on LeetCode and experience in full-stack development, I’m actively seeking software engineering roles. I love participating in hackathons, developing innovative solutions, and mentoring others in DSA and full-stack projects.

Feel free to explore, star ⭐, or contribute to the repository!
